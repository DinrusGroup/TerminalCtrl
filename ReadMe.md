## [Introduction](#introduction)

Terminal package is a flexible, easy-to-use yet powerful cross-platform virtual terminal emulation widget and library written in C/C++ for [Ultimate++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/).  

Terminal package is designed from the ground up with modularity and maintainability in mind, and it is not based on the existing terminal emulation libraries.

## [Requirements](#requirements)

- Ultimate++ (ver. >= 2020.1)
- POSIX (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), Windows, or MacOS
- A decent enough C/C++ compiler that supports at least C++11. (GCC/CLANG/MinGW/Msc)
- Snacks & beer.

## [Highlights](#highlights)

- **Terminal package completely separates the virtual terminal from the pseudo-terminal process (pty)**.
As a result, Terminal package and its Terminal ctrl are not bound by any platform-specific pty implementation. Instead, they are decoupled, and an optional pty process class, PtyProcess, is provided with tha package as the default option. In this way, using the Terminal widget on any platform supported by Ultimate++, directly as a front-end for some other terminal based services, such as SSH or TELNET, etc., has become possible. This point is demonstrated with one of the provided  examples: While the PtyProcess is currently not available on Windows (it's a TODO), Terminal widget can be compiled, run, and used on Windows, or on other supported platforms, as an SSH terminal. (See the *Examples* section.)

- **Terminal package is designed with simplicity in mind.**
A fully-fledged terminal emulation requires less than 50 sLoC. In fact, the first basic example provided with the package is only a single .cpp file with 29 sLoC, and it can run complex/heavy applications with mouse tracking and embedded images support, such as [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) text editor, [Lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/), [GNUPlot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), a vim inspired file manager with inline image preview support, or [mapscii](https://github.com/rastapasta/mapscii), an OpenStreetMap implementation for [xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) compatible virtual terminal emulator, or even [Jexer](https://jexer.sourceforge.io/), a java-based modern and slick text user interface (TUI) and windowing system for modern terminal emulators, and [xterm Window Manager,](https://gitlab.com/klamonte/xtermwm) with ease.

- **Terminal package combines simplicity with configurability.** 
Although it is easy to use, and requires very little coding, Terminal ctrl is by no means restrictive. It it highly configurable.

- **Terminal widget is a regular ctrl.**
It is derived from Upp::Ctrl, and is following the same basic rule: *Everthing belongs somewhere*. It supports most of the generic Ctrl methods where applicable or makes sense. Of course, If you are determined enough, you can even do some “interesting” things, such as embedding Terminal instances into TreeCtrl nodes or Arrayctrl rows. ;)

- ***Everything belongs somewhere* rule runs through the heart of Terminal package.**
There are no manual memory allocations/deallocations, no new/delete pairs, and no smart/not-so-smart/shared pointers in the code; only the containers, and extensive application of the [RAII](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization) principle.

- **Terminal widget supports true color.**
Ultimate++ Terminal widget is a true color (24-bit/16M color) virtual terminal emulator. It supports RGB, CMY, CMYK, and  indexed (256-color) palettes via SGR extended colors sequences. 

- **Terminal widget supports inline images.**
Terminal widget has a flexible infrastructure and support for inline images and image manipulation in general. It can handle [sixel graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel?oldformat=true) with 4/16/256 colors, or high/true color.  It also supports JPG, PNG, BMP raster image formats, or raw RGB images via [iTerm2's inline images protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html),  and [jexer image protocol](https://gitlab.com/klamonte/jexer/-/wiki_pages/jexer-images), a simple and useful wire protocol which allows terminals to display popular true color image formats. In fact, since the terminal widget uses the common raster decoding api of Ultimate++, theoretically it can display any raster image that has a registered decoder.  Terminal ctrl uses Upp::Display objects to display the embedded images. Client code can set the image display to one of the predefined display objects that'll process or manipulate the images before they are displayed (stretch/scale/colorize/flip/add text, etc., you name it), and the changes will immediately take place. Moreover, developers can create their own cell displays tailored for their specific needs. Terminal widget also supports an external image viewing mode, where the image data is handed to client code for rendering and external viewing.

- **Terminal widget can also run inside a web browser such as Firefox and Chromium, or their derivatives.**
  Thanks to Ultimate++ team, it is possible to run U++ GUI applications from within a web browser that supports HTML-5 canvas and websockets. And Terminal package is no exception. Applications using Terminal ctrl can basically turn into a remote terminal that can be accessed via any decent web browser (even from a smartphone!) if compiled with the TURTLE flag. (See the *Examples* section).

- **Terminal package has a** [BSD 3-Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses?oldformat=true#3-clause_license_%28%22BSD_License_2.0%22,_%22Revised_BSD_License%22,_%22New_BSD_License%22,_or_%22Modified_BSD_License%22%29) **license**.

- **Terminal widget can run Crysis.**
  Amazing, isn't it?

## [Specifications](#specs)

-  For more information on the supported terminal sequences, modes, extensions, etc., see [the technical specifications document](./Specs.md).
 
## [Examples](#examples)
As it is already noted above, one of the strengths of the Terminal Package is that it allows you to do more with less. The examples provided below are meant to illustrate this point. Five examples are provided with the package:

1. Basic terminal
2. Ssh terminal
3. Terminal in a web browser
4. Terminal splitter
5. Ssh terminal splitter

### Basic Terminal Example
This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Terminal widget and its interaction with the PtyProcess class. Creating an xterm-compatible virtual terminal emulator with inline images and mouse tracking support requires only 29 sLoC:	

```C++    	
#include <Terminal/Terminal.h>
#include <Terminal/PtyProcess.h>

using namespace Upp;

const char *nixshell = "/bin/bash";

struct TerminalExample : TopWindow {
	Terminal term;
	PtyProcess pty;
	
	TerminalExample()
	{
		SetRect(term.GetStdSize());  // 80 x 24 cells (scaled).
		Sizeable().Zoomable().CenterScreen().Add(term.SizePos());
		term.WhenBell   = [=]()         { BeepExclamation(); };
		term.WhenTitle  = [=](String s) { Title(s);          };
		term.WhenOutput = [=](String s) { pty.Write(s);      };
		term.WhenResize = [=]()         { pty.SetSize(term.GetPageSize()); };
		term.InlineImages().Hyperlinks().WindowOps();
		pty.Start(nixshell, Environment(), GetHomeDirectory());
		SetTimeCallback(-1, [=] ()
		{
			term.WriteUtf8(pty.Get());
			 if(!pty.IsRunning())
				Break();
		});
	}
};

GUI_APP_MAIN
{
	TerminalExample().Run();
}
```
Yup, that's all.

### Ssh Terminal Example
This example demonstrates the basic interaction between the Terminal and SshShell classes. Thus, it is also illustrating the first point put forth in the *Highlights* section above, since the SSH package of Ultimate++ can run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

Creating an xterm-compatible virtual SSH terminal with inline images and mouse tracking support requires only 43 sLoC:

```C++
#include <Core/Core.h>
#include <Core/SSH/SSH.h>
#include <Terminal/Terminal.h>

using namespace Upp;

String url = "demo:password@test.rebex.net:22";	// A well-known public SSH test server.

struct SshTerminal : Terminal, SshShell {
	SshTerminal(SshSession& session) : SshShell(session)
	{
		SshShell::Timeout(Null);
		SshShell::ChunkSize(65536);
		SshShell::WhenOutput = [=](const void *data, int size) { Terminal::Write(data, size); };
		Terminal::WhenOutput = [=](String data) { SshShell::Send(data); };
		Terminal::WhenResize = [=]() { SshShell::PageSize(Terminal::GetPageSize()); };
		Terminal::InlineImages().Hyperlinks().WindowOps();		
	}

	void Run(const String& termtype)
	{
		SshShell::Run(termtype, Terminal::GetPageSize());
		if(SshShell::IsError())
			ErrorOK(DeQtf(GetErrorDesc()));
	}
};

struct SshTerminalExample : TopWindow {
	void Run()
	{
		if(!EditTextNotNull(url, "SSH server", "Url"))
			return;
		SshSession session;
		session.WhenWait = [=]{ ProcessEvents(); };
		if(!session.Timeout(10000).Connect(url)) {
			ErrorOK(DeQtf(session.GetErrorDesc()));
			return;
		}
		SshTerminal term(session);
		SetRect(term.GetStdSize()); // 80 x 24 cells (scaled)
		Sizeable().Zoomable().CenterScreen().Add(term.SizePos());
		OpenMain();
		term.Run("xterm");
	}
};

GUI_APP_MAIN
{
	SshTerminalExample().Run();
}
```

### Terminal in a Web Browser Example

Now some cool stuff.

Ultimate++ has a package named "Turtle", which allows any U++ GUI application to be accessed via a web browser that supports websockets and HTML-5 canvas. It is basically an HTML-5 backend for GUI apps. To demonstrate this point, let's use the source code of the basic terminal example above. A few lines of extra code will turn it into a remote terminal that can be accessed via any decent web browser, such as Firefox or Chromium!

```C++
#include <Terminal/Terminal.h>
#include <Terminal/PtyProcess.h>

using namespace Upp;

const char *nixshell = "/bin/bash";

struct TerminalExample : TopWindow {
	Terminal term;
	PtyProcess pty;
	
	TerminalExample()
	{
		SetRect(term.GetStdSize());	// 80 x 24 cells (scaled).
		Sizeable().Zoomable().CenterScreen().Add(term.SizePos());
		term.WhenBell   = [=]()         { BeepExclamation(); };
		term.WhenTitle  = [=](String s) { Title(s);          };
		term.WhenOutput = [=](String s) { pty.Write(s);      };
		term.WhenResize = [=]()         { pty.SetSize(term.GetPageSize()); };
		term.InlineImages().Hyperlinks().WindowOps();
		pty.Start(nixshell, Environment(), GetHomeDirectory());
		SetTimeCallback(-1, [=] ()
		{
			term.WriteUtf8(pty.Get());
			 if(!pty.IsRunning())
				Break();
		});
	}
};

void Main()
{
	TerminalExample().Run();
}

#ifdef flagTURTLE
CONSOLE_APP_MAIN
{
	StdLogSetup(LOG_COUT|LOG_FILE);

	MemoryLimitKb(100000000);
	Ctrl::host = "localhost";
	Ctrl::port = 8888;
	Ctrl::connection_limit = 15; // Maximum number of concurrent users (preventing DDoS)

#ifdef _DEBUG
	Ctrl::debugmode = true;      // Only single session in debug (no forking)
#endif
	if(Ctrl::StartSession()) {
		Main();
		Ctrl::EndSession();
	}
	LOG("Session Finished");
}
#else
GUI_APP_MAIN
{
	Main();
}
#endif
```

### Terminal Splitter Example

As it is already mentioned in the *Highlights* section, Terminal ctrl is a regular widget, i.e it is not much different from other UI elements such as buttons, treeviews, lists, arrays, color pickers, etc., albeit a more complex one. It follows the ingenious design of the Ultimate++ widget library as closely as possible.

Below two example illustrate a way of creating more advanced user interfaces with the Terminal package, simply by using a splitter widget. A splitter is a container widget that can be used to split any parent widget into resizable horizontal or vertical panes. The second terminal splitter example is basically a variant of the first one except that it has the same extra code as in basic terminal example above, and runs on the Turtle HTML-5 backend:

(Note that you can also use tabs *instead of/with* splitters: A tabbed terminals example is also provided with package.)

```C++
#include <Terminal/Terminal.h>
#include <Terminal/PtyProcess.h>

// This  example  demonstrates a  simple terminal  splitter.
// It uses PtyProcess, therefore it is currently POSIX-only.

const char *nixshell = "/bin/bash";
const int  MAXPANECOUNT = 4;  // You can increase the number of panes if you like.

using namespace Upp;

struct TerminalPane : Terminal, PtyProcess {
	Splitter& parent;
	TerminalPane(Splitter& ctrl) : parent(ctrl)
	{
		Terminal::InlineImages().Hyperlinks().WindowOps();
		Terminal::WhenBell   = [=]()         { BeepExclamation();    };
		Terminal::WhenOutput = [=](String s) { PtyProcess::Write(s); };
		Terminal::WhenResize = [=]()         { PtyProcess::SetSize(GetPageSize()); };
		PtyProcess::Start(nixshell, Environment(), GetHomeDirectory());	// Defaults to TERM=xterm
		parent.Add(Terminal::SizePos());
	}
	
	void Do()
	{
		Terminal::WriteUtf8(PtyProcess::Get());
		if(!PtyProcess::IsRunning()) {
			parent.Remove(*this);
			parent.Layout();
		}
	}
	
	bool Key(dword key, int count) override
	{
		// Let the parent handle the SHIFT + CTRL + T key.
		return key != K_SHIFT_CTRL_T ? Terminal::Key(key, count) : false;
	}
};

struct TerminalSplitterExample : TopWindow {
	Splitter splitter;
	Array<TerminalPane> panes;
	
	bool Key(dword key, int count) override
	{
		if(key == K_SHIFT_CTRL_T) AddPane();
		return false;
	}

	void AddPane()
	{
		if(splitter.GetCount() < MAXPANECOUNT)
			panes.Create<TerminalPane>(splitter);
	}

	void Run()
	{
		Title(t_("Terminal splitter (Press CTRL + SHIFT + T to split the view)"));
		Sizeable().Zoomable().CenterScreen().SetRect(0, 0,  1024, 600);
		Add(splitter.Horz());
		AddPane();
		OpenMain();
		while(IsOpen() && splitter.GetCount()) {
			ProcessEvents();
			for(TerminalPane& pane : panes) pane.Do();
			Sleep(10);
		}
	}
};

GUI_APP_MAIN
{
	TerminalSplitterExample().Run();
}
```

### Ssh Terminal Splitter Example
Given the flexiblity and power of Ultimate++, it is easy to modify the above splitter example, so that it can be used as a relatively fancy front-end for SSH2 shells. This example is cross-platform, and demonstrates the interaction between the Terminal widget and the Ultimate++'s Core/SSH package, in a multithreaded environment. 

```C++
#include <Core/SSH/SSH.h>
#include <Terminal/Terminal.h>

// This example demonstrates a multithreaded ssh terminal splitter
// It is using the  Core/SSH package, therefore it can be compiled
// for, and run on, Windows and  POSIX-compliant operating systems.

using namespace Upp;

String url = "demo:password@test.rebex.net:22";	// A well-known public SSH test server.

const int MAXPANECOUNT = 4; // You can increase the number of panes if you like.

struct SshTerminalPane : Terminal, SshShell {
	Splitter& parent;
	SshTerminalPane(SshSession& session, Splitter& ctrl) : SshShell(session), parent(ctrl)
	{
		SshShell::Timeout(Null);
		SshShell::ChunkSize(65536);
		SshShell::WhenOutput = [=](const void *data, int size) { GuiLock __; Terminal::Write(data, size);     };
		SshShell::WhenWait   = [=]()                           { if(CoWork::IsCanceled()) SshShell::Abort();  };
		Terminal::WhenOutput = [=](String data)                { SshShell::Send(data);                        };
		Terminal::WhenResize = [=]()                           { SshShell::PageSize(Terminal::GetPageSize()); };
		Terminal::InlineImages().Hyperlinks().WindowOps();
		parent.Add(Terminal::SizePos());
	}
	
	void Run(const String& termtype)
	{
		SshShell::Run(termtype, Terminal::GetPageSize());
		GuiLock __;
		parent.Remove(*this);
		parent.Layout();
	}

	bool Key(dword key, int count) override
	{
		// Let the parent handle the SHIFT + CTRL + T key.
		return key != K_SHIFT_CTRL_T ? Terminal::Key(key, count) : false;
	}
};

struct SshTerminalSplitterExample : TopWindow {
	Splitter   splitter;
	SshSession session;
	CoWorkNX   workers; // Same as CoWork, but can be used as a member.

	bool Key(dword key, int count) override
	{
		if(key == K_SHIFT_CTRL_T) AddPane();
		return false;
	}

	void AddPane()
	{
		if(splitter.GetCount() < MAXPANECOUNT) {
			workers & [=] {
				EnterGuiMutex();                            // Note: Ctrl derived classes can only be
				SshTerminalPane shell(session, splitter);   // initialized in main thread OR vith gui
				LeaveGuiMutex();                            // mutex. (GuiLock)
				shell.Run("xterm");
			};
		}
	}

	void Run()
	{
		if(!EditTextNotNull(url, "SSH server", "Url"))
			Exit(1);

		session.WhenWait = [=] { if(IsMainThread()) ProcessEvents(); };

		if(!session.Timeout(10000).Connect(url)) {

## [Known Issues](#issues)

Nothing is perfect and Terminal package is no exception. Known major issues are listed below.

- Function keys and editor keys are not handled properly on some notebooks.

## [Version](#version)

Terminal package is currently at v0.3. (It is considered a beta until v1.0)

## [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)

*Note that below list is incomplete and to be written...*
- vttest, and other test scripts written for xterm are extensively used in testing of the Terminal ctrl. (Thanks [Thomas E. Dickey](https://invisible-island.net/home.html)!)
- ncurses, its demos and tests are also used in developing the Terminal package.
- [esctest](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/tree/61660349070fd4c75d1dbf333db0aabf2456c938/tests/esctest) test suite, automatic unit tests for terminal emulation, is heavily used in testing of Terminal ctrl. (Thanks [George Nachman](https://github.com/gnachman)!)

- [Jexer](https://jexer.sourceforge.io/), a modern text user interface (TUI) and [xterm Window Manager](https://gitlab.com/klamonte/xtermwm) for terminal emulators, are heavily used as a test-bed for polishing the inline images support for Terminal ctrl. And hopefully it will continue to be a test bed for future versions of the Terminal package. (Thanks [Kevin Lamonte](https://gitlab.com/klamonte)!)

- img2sixel of [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel/) is used heavily for testing the sixel images support of Terminal ctrl.
